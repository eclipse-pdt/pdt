<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>
The tool have some preferences which may be configured by advanced users.
This must be done carefully otherwise, either no data could be read by the tool
and/or generated results could be puzzled.
</p><p>
Here's what the page looks like:
<p><img src="images/preferences.png" alt="Preferences"/></p>

<h2>Database</h2>
<p>
By default the tool does not connect to any performance results database as common
users might not have enough rights to access it. However, users having these
rights may want to look at the database contents and update the local data files
with it. Hence, it is possible to configure the tool to connect to a database
which may be either local or on the releng server (<code><b>trelenggtk</b></code>).
</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>
These are the list of the version milestones. Each milestone is a date string
using the <b>yyyymmddHHMM</b> format. When a new milestone is shipped, then a new
date must be added to this preference to let the tool to identify it in the builds
list and emphasize it...
</p>

<h2>Default dimension</h2>
<p>
This is the dimension used to compute delta and make the verification. Currently
this is the <b>Elapsed Process Time</b> dimension.
</p><p>
<i>Note that the default dimension must belong to the <b>Results dimensions</b>
described below, hence a new selected dimensions will always be automatically
added to the list...</i>
</p>

<h2>Results dimensions</h2>
<p>
These are dimensions displayed in the scenario data HTML pages. Currently there
are the <b>Elapsed Process Time</b> and the <b>CPU Time</b>. Having these dimensions
configurable may be interesting to display others dimensions and see whether their
numbers may be relevant or not (e.g. <b>Used Hava Heap</b>).
</p><p>
<i>Note that the default dimension described above must belong to the selected
dimensions, hence it will always be automatically added to the new selected list...</i>
