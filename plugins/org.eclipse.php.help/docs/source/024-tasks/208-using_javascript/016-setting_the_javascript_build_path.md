# Setting the JavaScript Build Path

<!--context:setting_the_javascript_build_path-->

The JavaScript build process scans all files, folders, projects and libraries that are on the project's JavaScript Build Path so that resources which are referenced in the project can be made available for Content Assist options . The required resources must therefore be included in the JavaScript Build Path.

JavaScript's Build Path allows you to select JavaScript resources to include/exclude from this process. Rather than automatically scanning all referenced projects and libraries, configuring the JavaScript Build Path allows you to select which resources will be scanned, and so can significantly speed up the build process.

<!--note-start-->

#### Note:

JavaScript Support must be <[enabled for the project](008-enabling_javascript_support_in_php_projects.md) before you can set the JavaScript Build Path.

<!--note-end-->

The JavaScript Build Path is determined by the resources included in the project's JavaScript Libraries properties page.

<!--ref-start-->

To configure the project's JavaScript Build Path:

 1. In PHP Explorer view, right-click the required project and select Properties | JavaScript | JavaScript Libraries.  In this properties page you can add the following elements to the project's JavaScript Build Path:
 2. [Libraries](#Libraries) - Built-in and user defined libraries contain pre-written collections of JavaScript source files that have prototyped object/class definitions and JsDoc.
 3. [Global Super Types](#Global_SuperType) - Each object/field/function in the added libraries will be added to the project's Global Scope. Every JavaScript file in the project will then have access to these objects/fields/functions.
 4. [Source](#Source) - Other folders/files/variables from your file system or linked from an external source.
 5. [Projects](#Projects) - Other projects in the workspace or on your file system

### Libraries Tab

If your project references a JavaScript library, it should be added to this list so that it's elements can be available for Content Assist options.

Through the Libraries tab you can add PDT 's built-in libraries, or create and add your own User Libraries.

<!--note-start-->

### Note:

The default Runtime Libraries (Script Language Libraries, Web Project support for JSDT and ECMA 3 Browser Support Library) are added to the JavaScript Build Path automatically.

<!--note-end-->

  3. Enter a name for the library you would like to add and click OK.  The library name will be added to the User Libraries list. This is just a placeholder name to which you will add the required files in order to create your own library.
  4. Select the name from the list and click 'Add .js.'
  5. In the .js File Selection dialog, browse to the required JavaScript files on your file system and click Open.
  6. The JavaScript files will be added to your User Library. <br />![javascript_user_libraries_preferences.png](images/javascript_user_libraries_preferences.png "javascript_user_libraries_preferences.png")
  7. Click OK to return to the User Library selection list.
4. Mark the checkbox of the User Library you would like to add to the project's Build Path and click Finish.  The User Library will be added to the project's JavaScript Libraries Build Path list.

To add a library folder from your Workspace to the JavaScript Build Path:

1. Click the 'Add a Library Folder' button.  The library folder selection dialog will display a list of available folders.
2. Select the required folder(s) and click OK.

### Global Super Type Tab

The project's Global Scope contains all the objects, fields and functions contained in the libraries which have been added to the JavaScript Build Path. Elements in the Global SuperType will be available to all PHP and JavaScript files within the project.

![javascript_global_supertype.png](images/javascript_global_supertype.png "javascript_global_supertype.png")

In addition, the Global SuperType tab allows you to select a 'SuperType' class. All JavaScript elements which are not defined in their own class will automatically be added to this class. This will allow you to select these elements from the Content Assist list according to the SuperType Class name you selected.

To configure the SuperType class:

 1. Click the 'Select & Re-order Libraries' button.  The JavaScript Sourcefile SuperType Selection dialog will open.
 2. Select the class name for the SuperType class and click OK.  All elements which are not defined in a class will be added to the selected class. Entering the class name will display these elements in the Content Assist list.

### Source Tab

The Source tab allows you to include/exclude specific files, folders and variables from the JavaScript Build Path.
