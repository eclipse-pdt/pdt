# Adding Comments

<!--context:how_to_comment_and_uncomment_php_code-->

PDT allows you to quickly and easily comment and uncomment code by selecting a line or a block of text and tagging it as a comment.

Comments can be added to single lines of code (**Ctrl + /**) or blocks of code (**Ctrl + Shift + /**).

In addition, special PHPDocBlock comments can also be added. See "[Adding PHP DocBlock Comments](128-commenting_php_docblocks.md)" for more information.

The following procedures describe how to comment and uncomment lines and blocks of code.
