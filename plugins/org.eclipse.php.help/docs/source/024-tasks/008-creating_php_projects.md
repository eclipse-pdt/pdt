    * Project name - The required project name
    * Contents - Select whether to:

    * PHP Version - Select whether to:
    * Use default PHP settings - Uses the default PHP Interpreter settings.
    * Use project specific settings - Select the PHP version to be used for the project and whether ASP tags are used as PHP tags.  See [PHP Version Support](../016-concepts/008-php_support.md) for more information
    * Project Layout - Select whether to:
    * Use project as source folder - All resources within the project will be added to the Build Path by default.
    * Create separate folders for source files and public resources - Separate folders will be created in which you can place resources which should be included or excluded from the Build Path.  See [Configuring a Project's PHP Build Path](176-configuring_build_paths.md) for more information.The default setting for this option can be configured from the [New Project Layout Preferences](../032-reference/032-preferences/048-new_project_layout_preferences.md) page.
    * JavaScript Support - Mark the 'Enable JavaScript support for this project' checkbox for JavaScript functionality (e.g. JavaScript Content Assist options) to be available to the project.  See [Enabling JavaScript Support in PHP Projects](../024-tasks/208-using_javascript/008-enabling_javascript_support_in_php_projects.md) for more information.
 2. Click **Next** to [configure the project's Include Path](168-adding_elements_to_a_project_s_include_path.md) (this can also be done following the project creation).
 3. Click **Next** to [configure the project's PHP Build Path](176-configuring_build_paths.md) (this can also be done following project creation).
 4. Click **Finish**.

The new PHP project will be created in your workspace and displayed in [PHP Explorer View](../032-reference/008-php_perspectives_and_views/008-php_perspective_views/008-php_explorer_view.md).

You can now start to develop your application by [creating PHP Files](../024-tasks/016-file_creation/000-index.md) or adding other resources to your project.
