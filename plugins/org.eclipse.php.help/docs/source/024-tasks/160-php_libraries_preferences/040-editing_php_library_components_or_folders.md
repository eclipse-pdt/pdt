# Editing PHP Library Components or Folders

<!--context:editing_php_library_components_or_folders-->

This procedure describes how to edit user library folders. Edit a user library folder when you have imported a folder who's original location is different from its content's location on your disk. For more information see [Importing PHP User Libraries](024-importing_php_user_libraries.md).

**To edit a library component:**

 1. Go to **Window**| **Preferences** | **PHP** | **PHP Libraries**.
 2. In the PHP Libraries Preferences page select the user library folder to edit and click **Edit...** The "Edit External folder" dialog will open.
 3. Select the folder that contains the user library content, or create a new folder by clicking **Make a New Folder**.
 4. To apply changes click **OK**.

You have now edited your user library's URL which will import the content from the proper location on the disk.

#### Note:

If the imported location of the selected file you are editing is different than the new location, the new location will overwrite it.
