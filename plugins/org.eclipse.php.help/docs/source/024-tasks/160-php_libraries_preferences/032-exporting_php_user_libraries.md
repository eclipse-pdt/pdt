# Exporting PHP User Libraries

<!--context:exporting_php_user_libraries-->

This procedure describes how to export user libraries, making them accessible to whoever has access to the repository where it is stored. Exporting a user library will only export a description of the library in .xml format, and will not include any of the library's content.

**To export a user library:**

 1. Go to **Window**| **Preferences** | **PHP** | **PHP Libraries**.
 2. In the PHP Libraries Preferences page select the user library you would like to export and click **Export...**The "Export User Libraries" dialog will open.
 3. Select the library you would like to export by clicking the check box beside it. You may also use the **Select All** or the **Deselect All** buttons.
 4. To choose where you would like to export your library to, fill in the "File location:" text field with the URL, or click **Browse...**and select the location.
 5. To apply changes click **OK**.

Your user library has now been exported to the location you specified.

You may now import the exported user libraries from any location that has access to the location in which it is stored. For more information see [Importing PHP User Libraries](024-importing_php_user_libraries.md).
