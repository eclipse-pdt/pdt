# Editing PHP User Libraries

<!--context:editing_php_user_libraries-->

This procedure describes how to edit user libraries. You will need to edit a user library when you would like to change it's name. Changing a library's name allows you to create descriptive differentiations between your libraries. In order to edit a library, there must be libraries available. For more information see [Importing User Libraries](#Importing User Libraries) or [Adding a PHP Library](#Adding a PHP Library).
