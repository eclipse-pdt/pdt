# Accessing an Existing CVS Checkout

<!--context:accessing_an_existing_cvs_checkout-->

This procedure shows you how to access projects in PDT that you have previously checked out from CVS. This means you do not have to check out resources again to a new location in order to have access to PDT 's functionality.

<!--ref-start-->

To access previously checked out projects:

 1. Launch the New PHP Project Wizard by going to **File | New | PHP Project** -or- right-clicking in PHP Explorer view and selecting **New | PHP Project**.  The "New PHP Project" wizard will open.
 2. In the Project contents category, unmark the Use default checkbox and browse to the location of your checked out CVS resources.<br />

 3. Click **Finish**.  A new PHP Project will be created with the contents of the project you had checked out.
 4. In PHP Explorer View, right-click your project and select **Team | Share Project**.  A "Share Project" dialog will open.
 5. From the repository list, select CVS and click **Next**.
 6. If you have not yet configured a CVS repository, you will need to enter your CVS repository details. See Configuring a CVS Connection for more information.  If you have already configured a CVS connection, mark the 'Use existing repository location' option and select your repository from the list.
 7. Click **Finish**.
 8. Depending on your authentication settings, a dialog might appear asking you to provide authentication information.  Enter your password and click **Next**. (Mark the Save Password checkbox to ensure that this screen does not reappear.)  A "Commit" dialog will open.
 9. Enter a comment if required and click **OK**.

Your project will be uploaded to the CVS repository.

Your project will have a repository icon ![svn_repository_icon.png](images/svn_repository_icon.png "svn_repository_icon.png")next to it in PHP Explorer view, indicating that it is linked to an CVS repository.  Your can now perform all CVS functions (commit, update etc.) on this project.
