<!--context:using_the_inspect_action-->

The Inspect Action is a quick way to evaluate an expression when debugging your PHP script.

<!--ref-start-->

 1. Set a breakpoint to your code by double-clicking the vertical ruler to the left of the line where you want to set the breakpoint -or- select the line and go to **Run | Toggle Breakpoint** or press **Ctrl+Shift+B.HERE**.  A blue ball will appear, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.
 2. Select an expression in the editor and from the Right Click Menu select **Inspect**- or - press **Ctrl+Shirft+I**.  The evaluated expression is shown. <br />![inspect_action.png](images/inspect_action.png "inspect_action.png")
