# Refactor Menu

<!--context:refactor-->

The Refactor menu allows you to edit names and locations of files and resources.  
For more information on refactoring, see [Using Refactoring](../../024-tasks/116-using_refactoring/000-index.md).

The options available from the Refactor menu are:

<table>
<tr><td>Move</td>
<td>Alt+Shift+V</td>
<td>Moves a file to a different folder. <br /><br />
To move a file, select it from the Project Explorer view.<br /><br />
A Move dialog will open. Select the required folder and click Preview to see all changes that will be made as a result of the Move.<br /><br />
Click OK to implement your changes and move the file. All references to the file will be automatically updated to reflect its new location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rename</td>
<td>Alt+Shift+R</td>
<td>Renames a file or element.<br /><br />
To rename a file, select it from the Project Explorer view. To rename an element within a file select it from the Project Explorer view or highlight it in the editor view.<br /><br />
A rename dialog will open. Enter the new name and click Preview to see all changes that will be made as a result of the rename.<br /><br />
Click OK to implement your changes. All references to the file / element will be automatically updated to reflect the change.</td></tr>

#### Note:

Refactoring options will only be available from within Project Explorer view and not from Navigator view.  
Using the Navigator view's move/rename functions will not update any referenced instances of the file/element.
