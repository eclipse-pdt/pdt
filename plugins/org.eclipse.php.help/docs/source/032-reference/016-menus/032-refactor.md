Click OK to implement your changes and move the file. All references to the file will be automatically updated to reflect its new location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rename</td>
<td>Alt+Shift+R</td>
<td>Renames a file or element.<br /><br />
To rename a file, select it from the PHP Explorer view. To rename an element within a file select it from the PHP Explorer view or highlight it in the editor view.<br /><br />

#### Note:

Refactoring options will only be available from within PHP Explorer view and not from Navigator view.  Using the Navigator view's move/rename functions will not update any referenced instances of the file/element.
