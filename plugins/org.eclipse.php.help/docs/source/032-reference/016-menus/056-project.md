# Project Menu

<!--context:project-->

The Project menu allows you to carry out different functions on your projects, including open, close, build and encode.

<!--note-start-->

#### Note:

For more information on the build process, see the topic in the Workbench User Guide.

<!--note-end-->

The option**s available from the Project menu are:**

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th>
<th>Shortcut</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>Open Project</td>

<td></td>

<td>Opens the currently selected project (if closed)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Close Project</td>

<td></td>

<td>Closes the currently selected project.
<br />
Closing a project does not cause it to be deleted from the file system. A closed project will still be displayed in PHP Explorer view, with a ![closed_project_icon.png](images/closed_project_icon.png "closed_project_icon.png")closed project icon, but its resources are no longer accessible from within the Workbench.
<br />
Closing projects takes up less memory and speeds up the build process.</td></tr>
