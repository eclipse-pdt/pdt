# Code Commenting

<!--context:commenting_code-->

Commenting your code involves adding characters (normally slashes and stars) which mark certain areas of code as 'comments'.

Comments are used for reference information only and will not be run as part of your code. It is good programming practice to comment all functions, classes and methods in your code. This helps both the developer and others who might look at the code to understand its purpose.

Comments can be either single line or multi-lined:

 * Single lined comments will have the following format:


    // This is a single line comment.

 * Multi-lined comments will have the following format:


    /* This is
    a comment
    on multiple
    lines
    */
