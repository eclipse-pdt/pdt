# Bookmarks

<!--context:bookmarks-->

Bookmarks can be used as placeholders within your scripts to allow easy navigation to pre-defined places within your scripts and resources.

Bookmarks are indicated by a bookmark icon ![bookmark_icon.gif](images/bookmark_icon.gif "bookmark_icon.gif") in the vertical marker bar to the left of the editor.

Bookmarks are displayed in the Bookmarks view, which can be opened by going to **Window | Show View | Bookmarks**.
