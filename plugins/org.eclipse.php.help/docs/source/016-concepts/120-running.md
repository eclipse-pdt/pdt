# Running

<!--context:running-->

PDT allows you to run the applications you are working on from the workbench. This allows you to run and test your applications during development.

PDT includes several different methods of running your files and applications:

### PHP Script Local Running

Allows you to run files situated in your workspace. This enables you to locally validate freshly developed code before deploying to a Web server. Using this option, you can run applications which do not require user input or responses from the server.

See [Running PHP Scripts Locally](../024-tasks/144-running_files_and_applications/008-running_php_scripts_locally.md) for more information.

#### Note:

Your server must be running the Xdebug or Zend Debugger in order for remote debugging  capabilities to function.

### PHP Web Page Running

Allows you to run applications situated on a server, including any required interactive user input.

#### Note:

It's recommended that your local project structure reflect the project structure on your server.

See [Running PHP Web Pages](../024-tasks/144-running_files_and_applications/024-running_php_web_pages.md) for more information.
