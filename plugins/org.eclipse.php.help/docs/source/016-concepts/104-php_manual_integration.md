# PHP Manual Integration

<!--context:php_manual_integration-->

PDT can integrate with PHP Manual sites in order to get the most up-to-date PHP information.

The PHP Functions view lists all PHP functions contained within the PHP manuals, and can be used in order to easily add these functions into your scripts. To add a function to your code, simply place the cursor in the required position in the Editor and double-click the required element from the list.

You can open a PHP manual site with an explanation about most of the functions on the list by right-clicking a function in PHP Functions view and selecting **Open Manual**.
