/**
 * A wizard fragment is a node within a wizard that provides a completely
 * extendable wizard flow by supporting a flexible tree structure for the pages.
 * As the user walks pages through the wizard, they are actually traversing the
 * nodes of a tree, and each node can add or remove children at any time.
 * 
 * Each node may be non-UI (useful for injecting behaviour into the tree) or
 * contain a single wizard page (@see hasComposite() and
 * createComposite(Composite, IWizardHandle)). The node may also have children
 * (@see getChildFragments(), which should be updated or refreshed whenever the
 * updateChildFragments() method is called by another node to let this node know
 * that it's state may have changed.
 * 
 * This implementation uses a createChildFragments() method to allow the
 * fragment to add it's children into the tree. Note that this method may be
 * called multiple times as the tree is updated and it must return the same
 * instance of any children that have previously been returned.
 * 
 * @since 1.0
