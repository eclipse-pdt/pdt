/**
 * An IASTFragment represents 'part' of an AST, but not necessarily a subtree of
 * the AST. A fragment may simply be an instance of some sort of pattern or
 * formation in an AST. Such "fragments", however, do correspond to a contiguous
 * source code region, and, thus, posses a source start position, and a source
 * length. Every fragment maps to an ASTNode, although this mapping is not
 * necessarily straightforward, and more than one fragment may map to a given
 * node.
 * 
 * Fragments support abstract operations, which support the notion of 'matching'
 * fragments. One operation determines whether a fragment 'matches' a given
 * fragment. Another operation finds all sub-fragments (fragments contained
 * within a parent fragment, including the parent itself) which 'match' another
 * given fragment.
